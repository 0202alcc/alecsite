					Growing up in Canarsie, Brooklyn, I became affiliated with a program called Prep for Prep. Prep for Prep is a highly selective leadership development program that prepares students for placement in leading independent
					schools and continues to work closely with the students through high school graduation and beyond. Through Prep, I got numerous awards, scholarships, and internships. I was also awarded
					a full time scholarship to the Browning School. It was here that I began developing interests in engineering, computer science, and robotics. You can check out some of my accomplishments below.

				<h3>Los Angeles, California</h3>

					In August of 2020, at the peak of COVID, I began attending Harvey Mudd College as a Presidential Scholar.
					Harvey Mudd College (HMC) is one of the premier engineering, science and mathematics colleges in the United States.
					HMC educates engineers, scientists and mathematicians who become leaders in their fields and have a clear understanding of the impact their work has on society.
					At Harvey Mudd, I pursued an Engineering degree with a concentration in Asian-American Studies. While at Mudd, I was involved with the Associated Students of Harvey Mudd College Senate as a Dorm President, the "Kasama" Filipinx Affinity Group, and worked as a 'Grutor' to name a few of my responsibilities.
					Through Mudd, I was also able to conducte research on and off campus in both humanities and STEM fields. I ended up involved working on projects with J.P. Morgan & Chase's AI Research Team, MIT Lincoln Labs,
					Silvus Technologies, Amazon Lab126, and Audio Technica. Feel free to check out the projects I worked on!
