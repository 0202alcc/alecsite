FIRST Tech Challenge is one of the six major robotics programs organized by FIRST, which its other five programs include FIRST Lego League Discover, FIRST Lego League Explore, FIRST Lego League Challenge, FIRST Robotics Competition, and FIRST Global Challenge. The competition consists of local and regional qualifiers and the world championship, the FIRST Championship, and in every season, a kickoff is held to showcase the season's theme and game. After kickoff, robots are designed, built, and programmed by teams, and teams are encouraged to conduct outreach with their communities. Local qualifiers are held for teams to compete and qualify for regional qualifiers, and from that point, regional qualifiers are held for teams to qualify for the world championship. The robot kit is Android-based, and it is programmed using Java, Kotlin, the Blocks programming interface, or other Android programming systems. Teams, with the guidance of coaches, mentors and volunteers, are required to develop strategy and build robots based on innovative, sound engineering principles. Awards are given for robot performance as well as for community outreach, design, and other real-world accomplishments."

The submitted system is an ensemble of five RoBERTa models each weighted by their respective F1-scores on the validation data-set. This system performed 13% better than the baseline and was the best performing system overall for this shared task."

This equipment can weigh up to 200 pounds and is difficult to transport. However, the equipment is susceptible to vibrations and must be transported smoothly. Professor Gallicchio wanted our team to design a cart that could transport this equipment smoothly while also allowing his experiments to be run on the cart. This way, setting up experiments and moving to different locations is much more convenient. Our solution uses aluminum extrusions and brackets for the main body of the cart to be strong yet lightweight. To dampen vibrations we used pneumatic wheels with a spring suspension system, and to run experiments in place we attached leveling mounts. The CAD model of our design passed stress tests of far beyond 200 pounds, and the final physical deliverable was approved by our client. The cart\u2019s height will likely be sized down, and the wheels may be switched out, but otherwise the cart was satisfactory."

                "content": "Light intensity decreases in water, particularly as depth increases. An autonomous surface vehicle (ASV) was designed and built to explore this phenomenon. The ASV was equipped to record light and color distortion underwater through sensor values and video. A pressure sensor was used for depth measurements, a GPS was used for location measurements, and light and color sensors were used to measure the visible light intensities. The pressure, color, and camera data were accurate and helped answer the research question, while the GPS data were imprecise and the light data were unusable."
